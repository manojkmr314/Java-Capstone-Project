				<h3>Our Employees</h3>
				<p>We believe our employees are our greatest asset. It is
					because of the talented healthcare professionals and support staff
					we employ that we are able to provide a variety of services to meet
					and respond to the needs of our clients and patients.</p>
				<br> <br>
				<h3>Commitment to Quality</h3>
				<h5>Quality Improvement Initiatives</h5>
				<p>We know that when it comes to healthcare, self-evaluation,
					and accountability are keys to maintaining and improving the
					quality of patient services. In pursuit of this goal, we have
					enhanced various programs which allow for continuous monitoring and
					improvement of the quality services that are delivered.</p>
				<h5>Quality Metrics</h5>
				<p>Our performance measurement system allows for the objective
					measurement of the clinical and operational performance of each
					local office. Defined best practices have been instituted and allow
					us to measure success â€“ identifying continuous improvement
					opportunities and aggregating and analyzing the results so that the
					company and quality committee may take the appropriate action to
					improve. The system takes advantage of the collective resources of
					the Clinical and Corporate Operations, Compliance, and Information
					Systems Departments to improve accountability and company
					efficiency.</p>
				<h5>Commitment to Clinical Compliance</h5>
				<p>We know that accountability and quality improvement go
					hand-in-hand. An independent team of full-time clinical compliance
					specialists reports directly to the Chief Compliance Officer. The
					team conducts internal audits of our offices and patient
					assessments to verify that the offices are performing their duties
					as eexpected.</p>
